# 📊 DMart Grocery Sales Forecasting

## 🚀 Overview
This project focuses on **time series forecasting** to predict future sales for **DMart grocery stores**. The goal is to analyze historical sales data, identify trends, and build models to generate accurate sales forecasts. This can help businesses optimize inventory, reduce stockouts, and improve revenue planning.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze historical sales data to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
- Develop **machine learning & statistical models** for sales forecasting.
- Compare the performance of models like **SARIMA, LSTM, and XGBoost**.
- Provide actionable insights for inventory and demand planning.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed sales trends over time.
- Identified seasonal patterns and holidays affecting sales.
- Used **ACF/PACF plots** to assess time series stationarity.
- Checked for missing values and outliers.

## 🔮 Models Implemented
- **SARIMA**: Captures seasonality and trends in sales data.
- **XGBoost Regressor**: Leverages machine learning for time series forecasting.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Deep learning approach for sequence modeling.

## 📉 Model Evaluation
- **Metrics Used**: RMSE, MAE, MAPE
- **SARIMA vs. LSTM vs. XGBoost**: Compared predictions to find the best-performing model.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** to improve accuracy.

## 🏆 Key Insights & Results
- **SARIMA performed well** for short-term forecasting.
- **LSTM captured long-term dependencies** but required more data.
- **XGBoost handled non-linear trends** and external variables effectively.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Incorporate **external factors** like holidays, promotions, and weather.
- Experiment with **Prophet**, a forecasting model by Facebook.
- Deploy an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit**.
- Optimize LSTM with **attention mechanisms** for better performance.
